"M.I.A Robotics Training 2023"  

First of all we have CProgrammin branch:
this branch has the first 4 tasks to practice C programming language 

Task 1.1 : Hello Gru
print "gru" either with letters or *

Task 1.2 : Counting Down
given number n, count down from n to 1 then print "Blast off to the moon!"

Task 1.3 : Task Manager
build a To-Do list with some features as "add task", "view tasks", "remove task" and "checked task"

Task 1.4 : Kalman Missile
fuse between the data of two sensores to get more accurate reading


Second, we have HardWare branch:
this branch has 3 tasks to apply circuits basics and electronics


Task 2.1 : Lightning the Dark
Design a circuit that takes 220V AC as input and the output is 5V DC and connects LED to the output

Task 2.2 : Air Extractor to Fan
Design a simple H-bridge driver to control the direction of the DC motor using transistors.

Task 2.3 : Box of Shame 
Calculate how many battaries connected in parallel to light up the LED for more than 5 hours given that every battery has 5200mA charge


Third, we have Arduino branch:
this branch has 2 tasks to use ardunio and tinkercad

Task 3.1 : Signal to Engage
use I2C protocol to make two arduinos communicate together and send buttons data to change the intinsity of a LED

Task 3.2 : Cookiebot
Localize the cookiebot in the room knowing that there are an obstacle in his way will make the bot localize his the position wrongly

Forthly, we have PythonAndML branch:
this branch has 2 tasks to implement python codes and OOP

Task 4.1 : Sky Clash
Design a game between GRU and vector to fight each other with the ability to use weapons and shields

Task 4.2 : Shrrinkage Model
Create Linear Regression Model, and train this model on the give dataset to determine the power needed to shrink the moon by given percentage


Here we Finished Phase One of the training :)
